# Tally App

This is my second piece of real Javascript. Here I went one step beyond and implemented a for and else statement which determines who is the winning team. 

Previously I only learn this as a concept with FreeCodeCamp and got blocked, so it's cool to have a real world example this time to write it with.

## Pushing

I'm also pushing and going back to the fundementals of GitHub. I've pushed and pulled already for a real world example by trial and error, so good to do this again as basic as it seems to make sure I'm not making any mistakes lol. Could be a life-saver in the future.
